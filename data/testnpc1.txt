He learned his craft from his father and grandfather, and his family has been the blacksmiths of Oakhaven for centuries. Recently, goblin raids have become more frequent, troubling the villagers. The Elder Council is worried about the increasing goblin activity and rumors of something darker stirring in the deep mines.
